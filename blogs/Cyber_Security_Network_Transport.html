                <h2>Cyber Security Network Transport</h2>
                <span>Switched Networks
Systems are connected to a LAN (&quot;Local Area Network&quot;) through a Switch. Switches uses MAC (&quot;Media Access Control&quot;) addresses for addressing, not the more well-known IP address. Switches forward traffic across Local Area Networks, i.e. your home-network or within branches of your organization. MAC Addresses are designed to be unique, but anyone can change their MAC Address as long as they have administrator rights.

The MAC address defined by 6 octets, for example: FC:F8:AE:12:34:56

The first three octets represent the organization which manufactured the device communicating, called OUI (&quot;Organizational Unique Identifier&quot;). The above MAC address is assigned to Intel Corporate. You can search for MAC Addresses in many places, for example: https://www.adminsub.net/mac-address-finder/intel.

The last three octets is determined by the manufacturer.

ARP
ARP (&quot;Address Resolution Protocol&quot;) is the protocol which allows computer systems to know which MAC address belongs to which IP address. If the traffic has to be routed, the computer system will forward traffic to the Default Gateway configured on the system.

ARP, like DNS, is a protocol which resolves one address into another. Every time a system tries to communicate to an IP address which is on the LAN it will check its ARP cache to see if has recently been resolved.

You can inspect your own ARP. Simply run the command arp -a on both Linux or Windows. This reveals which systems your system has recently communicated with.

Alice: Does anyone know the MAC address of 192.168.10.10?
Bob: Sure thing Alice, here is my MAC Address.
VLAN (&quot;Virtual LAN&quot;)
VLAN, often called Private VLAN&#039;s, is a way for a Switch to embed tags (or a VLAN ID) within the Frame. Multiple Switches can then make sure that computer systems on the LAN can only communicate to certain other systems, i.e. other systems on with the same VLAN ID.</span>
