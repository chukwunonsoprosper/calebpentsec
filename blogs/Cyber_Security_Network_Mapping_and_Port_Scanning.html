                <h2>Cyber Security Network Mapping and Port Scanning</h2>
                <span>If we are to defend, we first need to know what to defend. Asset Management often relies on Network Mapping to identify which systems are live on a network.

Asset management and knowing what you expose on the network, including which services are hosted is very important for anyone looking to defend their network.

Nmap - The Network Mapper
Nmap has for a long time been considered as the standard port scanner for both network engineers and security professionals. We can use it to discover assets to attack or defend.

Network Mapping
One way to identify hosts which are active on the network is to send a ping, i.e. ICMP Echo Request, to all IP Addresses in the network. This is often referred to as a Ping Sweep.

Ping Sweep

This approach is not very good in discovering assets. It is likely that systems on the network will ignore incoming pings, perhaps due to a Firewall blocking them or because of a Host-Based Firewall. A host-based firewall is simply a firewall which is implemented on the system instead of on the network. 

A better approach involves sending a different kinds of packets to a system to try ask for any kind of answer to determine if system is alive or not. For example Nmap will send the following packets to the system to try cause a response:

ICMP Echo Request
TCP SYN packet to port 443
TCP ACK packet to port 80
ICMP Timestamp request
Based on the TCP specifications, that is the rules of communications, a system should always engage in a three-way handshake before starting to communicate. Nmap seems to be intentionally breaking the rules with the packets above. Can you spot which packet is not behaving as systems would expect? 

Sending a TCP ACK packet to port 80 is not conforming to the rules of the TCP standard. Nmap does this specifically to try cause the target system to make a reply. In order to send packets which are not following the rules, Nmap must run with the highest level of privileges, e.g. root or local administrator. Most port scanners will be more accurate because of this.

Disabling the Network Mapping can be done with Nmap with the -Pn flag. Nmap will now consider all IP/systems to be up and go directly to port scanning.

Try this at home now if you would like to. Careful, if you are at a corporate environment, always get permission before you start running scanners as you do not want to violate any rules of your workspace. To try Nmap now, follow these simple steps: 

Go download Nmap at https://nmap.org. Make sure you download the version that matches your operating system
Install Nmap and launch the tool from a command line terminal
Find your local IP address and subnet
Run Nmap to scan it to see what kinds of systems it can discover: nmap -vv IP/netmask
We are adding two -v flag to tell Nmap we want verbose output, that makes the scan more fun to watch while it completes. 

Nmap Scan

ARP Scan
The ARP protocol is contained within a LAN, but if the hosts you need to discover is on the LAN we could use this protocol to try reveal systems on the network. By simply iterating over all available IP addresses on the LAN network with the ARP protocol, we are trying to force systems to reply.

The scan looks like this:

Eve: Please Provide Mac Address of system 192.168.0.1
Eve: Please Provide Mac Address of system 192.168.0.2
Eve: Please Provide Mac Address of system 192.168.0.3
Eve: Please Provide Mac Address of system 192.168.0.4
Eve: Please Provide Mac Address of system 192.168.0.5-254
Default Gateway: 192.168.0.1 is me and my MAC Address is AA:BB:CC:12:34:56
Bob: 192.168.0.3 is me and my MAC Address is: BB:CC:DD:12:34:56
Alice: 192.168.0.4 is me and my MAC Address is: CC:DD:EE:12:34:56</span>
