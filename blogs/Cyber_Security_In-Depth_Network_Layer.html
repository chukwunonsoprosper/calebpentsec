                <h2>Cyber Security In-Depth Network Layer</h2>
                <span>IP - The Internet Protocol
                    IP is used to communicate across networks, not just across physical links, but between networks of
                    routers. The addressing scheme in use is either IPv4 (&quot;IP Version 4&quot;) or IPv6 (&quot;IP
                    Version 6&quot;).

                    IP networks can be broken into different sections, often called subnets. This is accomplished by
                    adding an extra piece of information, together with the IP address, called a netmask. The netmask
                    dictates how large a network is and which packet is routed within the network and which should be
                    routed outside of the network.

                    Netmasks can be represented via decimal numbers or with a slash notation. When using slash notation,
                    the slash follows the systems IP address. Here are some examples:

                    IP Address Slash Notation Netmask
                    10.0.0.1 /8 - Example: 10.0.0.1/8 255.0.0.0
                    172.16.1.1 /12 - Example: 172.16.1.1/12 255.240.0.0
                    192.168.0.1 /16 - Example: 192.168.0.1/16 255.255.0.0
                    192.168.0.1 /24 - Example: 192.168.0.1/24 255.255.255.0
                    Some IP networks are reserved for only a certain kind of traffic. The IP addresses in the table
                    above are reserved for only internal organizational use, meaning they should not be routed on the
                    Internet. These kinds of IP addresses are commonly referred to as RFC1918 addresses.

                    Different Networks
                    Let us take a look at different networks within RFC1918 and how large the networks are:

                    10.0.0.0/8 - More than 16 million IP addresses
                    172.16.0.0/12 - About 1 million IP addresses
                    192.168.0.0/16 - 65534 IP addresses
                    IP segments can be further broken up into smaller and more granular networks.

                    Each network has a reserved address for broadcasting traffic to every host in the network, this is
                    called the broadcast address. Broadcasting data means sending data to everyone on the network
                    instead of sending to just a single host. There are many applications and protocols which rely on
                    broadcasting traffic in order for them to work.

                    For each network segment the broadcast is always last IP address in the network. For example in the
                    network 192.168.0.0/24 network, the broadcast address is 192.168.0.255.

                    The smallest netmask possible is 255.255.255.255, represented as /32. This network only has one IP
                    address.

                    If traffic needs to be sent back to the host, e.g. for communications between applications, it is
                    sent to the localhost address. This address is always 127.0.0.1 and is a /8 network.

                    In IP networks the traffic is routed by a router. A router is a networking device which understands
                    the IP format and can forward packets between networks. This is different than a switch as the
                    switch forwards data within a network, while the router forwards between networks.

                    Router and Switch

                    Packets on the network has headers which describe many of the important details we already discussed
                    within the IP protocol. IPv4 Header looks like this:

                    IP Header

                    Image Credits: By Michel Bakni - Postel, J. (September 1981) RFC 791, Internet Protocol, DARPA

                    The Source Address is the IP address of the system who is sending the packet, and destination is to
                    whom the packet is intended. There are also other fields in the header which is used by the many
                    features of the IP protocol, but which are outside the scope of this introduction class.

                    You can check your IP address on Windows by running the command ipconfig within a Command Line
                    Window. On Linux this is done with the ip addr show or ifconfig command.

                    When a computer needs to communicate to something which can not be found on the LAN, it sends
                    traffic to the default gateway as per how the system is configured. The default gateway being a
                    router which is capable of forwarding the traffic to the destination IP address.

                    NAT (&quot;Network Address Translation&quot;)
                    NAT allows a system accepting connections on a public IP address to map those requests to an
                    internal RFC 1918 IP address or vice versa. Systems which do NAT&#039;ing are typically firewalls
                    and routers.

                    A typical implementation of NAT is where the external IP address is used as a front for multiple
                    internal IP addresses, and the destination port number is used to decide which server the data
                    should be sent to. This allows internal IP addresses to receive traffic from external systems.

                    NAT Port

                    Another very common implementation is allowing internal IP addresses to access the internet with an
                    external IP address. The NAT keeps track of connections from internal to destination addresses and
                    forwards traffic across the connections.

                    NAT can be configured in many ways, but in this class you we do not go into more details of the
                    method.

                    Note: NAT allows network engineers to be more flexible with their deployments, allowing many
                    different use-cases to unfold.
                    IPv6 - IP Version 6
                    IP version 6 is the latest standard for IP and was made to support more IP addresses. Instead of
                    using 32 bits of addressing for IP addresses, 128 bits is used. This allows for enough IP addresses
                    for the foreseeable future while IPv4 has already run out.

                    IPv6 addresses uses 8 groups of of 4 hexadecimal numbers. An IPv6 address look like this:
                    2a00:1450:400f:80a::200e:. Notice it does not have have the 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal numbers. This
                    is because IPv6 addresses can be shortened via simple rules:

                    Leading 0&#039;s can be shortened
                    Double colon (::) can be used to represent a continuous string of 0&#039;s.
                    The expanded IPv6 address is: 2a00:1450:400f:080a:0000:0000:0000:200e.

                    The localhost can be reduced into ::1 and ::.

                    IPv6 has networks, i.e. subnets, just like IPv4 has.

                    The IPv6 header looks like this:

                    IPv6 Header

                    We can see a much simpler header with a lot more room for IP addressing.

                    IPv6 is used more and more, and there is built in support for this protocol in many tools. For
                    example with ping we can switch between IPv4 and IPv6 with the -4 and -6 flag respectively.

                    Run ipconfig and see if you see any IPv6 addresses. If you have IPv6 enabled, try ping -6 google.com
                    and ping -4 google.com. See how the command allows us to use either IPv4 or IPv6?

                    Note: If you do not have IPv6 today, there are many public cloud services which will grant you a
                    public IPv6 address today which you can use to experiment and explore with.
                    ICMP
                    ICMP is often associated with Ping and Traceroute. ICMP can be used for other things, such as ask a
                    node for its time referred to as an ICMP Timestamp request. An ICMP Timestamp request simply allows
                    e.g. a Router to ask another Router to synchronize their time, an important attribute in network
                    communications.

                    A common tactic for attackers to check if systems are available on a network, is to conduct a Ping
                    Sweep. The goal of such activity is to make the target device in a network range reply to ping
                    requests so that the attacker knows it is available. This approach is naive as many systems by
                    default block incoming pings.

                    Traceroute
                    Tracerouting is a way to determine which routers are involved in sending a packet from system A to
                    B. Knowing which routers our packets take can be useful both better understanding our networks and
                    also in understanding the attack surface. A router is responsible for routing the package in the
                    right direction. Imagine this as driving on a road, where road signs at intersections guide you to
                    the destination. These signs at intersections represent routers. Traceroute identify these signs and
                    intersections and tells you how far away they are, measured in milliseconds (ms).

                    The IPv4 TTL and IPv6 Hop Limit headers have the same function. Every router who routes a packet
                    will decrement this value by 1, and if the value reaches 0 the router will discard the packet and
                    return an ICMP Time Exceeded packet to the sender.

                    To perform a traceroute on Windows:</span>
